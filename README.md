Duration of Project: 08-09-2022 / 28-10-2022

Version 1.0

-----

## Quick Foreword
This is an individual project. I have been tasked with creating a Cyber Security solution to a self chosen problem within the field of Phishing Attacks.

-----

## Setup
This is a [Python Script](./scanner.py) with a [Blacklist text file](./blacklist.txt). There are also a few [test images](https://github.com/nilsvw/IP_ProjectSecurity/tree/main/test%20images#readme). 

Requirements:

- Python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- OpenCV-python (pip install opencv-python)

- Python-tesseract (pip install pytesseract)



Update line 67 in scanner.py -> Own Python-tesseract location

Running 'python scanner.py' in terminal will run the program

Can add own Blacklisted Email addresses in blacklist.txt
